            Aditya and Chinmay frustrated from their low paying, high labour
            jobs came up with an idea of why not do that high labour for
            themselves and earn even less money. Sameer tagged in thinking there
            is less mess in his life already, why not increase it. Now we are
            three trained export import strugglers trying to grow this business
            and earn money so that we'd find a girl, settle down and our parents
            stop thinking that we're useless.

            Also when someone asks, "what do you do for living?", Import Export
            business sounds Kickass ðŸ˜Ž. Lot's of companies are big, faceless and
            too busy. Well that ain't us. We're small and we care and we're here
            to help you import the hell out of India. India have lot to provide
            along with Trust, quality and Tandoori Naan.
